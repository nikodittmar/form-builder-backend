# Form Builder Backend
This project is split into two repositories. The back-end, built using Ruby on Rails, is in this repository. The front-end, built using React and Next.js, can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nikodittmar/form-builder-frontend). A list of features as well as screenshots and a video demonstration can be found in the front-end repository's README.md file.
